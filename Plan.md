# Envault — Secure Environment Variable Management Platform

You are a senior full-stack engineer, software architect, security engineer and product designer.

Build a production-quality platform called **Envault**.

> **Envault — Your environments, organized and protected.**

Envault allows developers to securely manage environment variables and secrets across multiple projects and environments.

The initial product is a modern Next.js web application. However, the architecture must support future clients such as:

* A VS Code extension.
* A command-line interface.
* A desktop application.
* Other approved integrations.

Do not create a superficial prototype. Build a maintainable, typed, testable and security-conscious application.

---

# 1. Core product requirements

Users must be able to:

* Register using email and password.
* Verify their email address.
* Log in and log out.
* Reset their password.
* Enable TOTP multi-factor authentication.
* Use authenticator applications such as Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator.
* Complete an MFA challenge during login.
* Create and unlock an encrypted vault.
* Create multiple projects.
* Create multiple environments under each project.
* Add, edit, rename, copy and delete environment variables.
* Hide sensitive values by default.
* Reveal values temporarily.
* Copy values to the clipboard.
* Import `.env` files and pasted dotenv content.
* Export environments in supported formats.
* Search and filter variables.
* Select multiple variables.
* Perform bulk updates.
* Copy variables between environments.
* Compare two environments.
* View revision history.
* Restore previous revisions.
* Review non-sensitive activity logs.
* Configure automatic vault locking.
* Use light and dark themes.

The first release is for individual users.

Do not implement team collaboration yet, but structure the platform so organizations, memberships, roles and shared vaults can be added later.

---

# 2. Required technology stack

Use:

* Next.js with the App Router.
* React.
* TypeScript with strict mode.
* `pnpm`.
* A `pnpm` workspace.
* Turborepo where useful.
* Tailwind CSS.
* shadcn/ui.
* Radix UI primitives.
* Lucide icons.
* Firebase Authentication.
* Firebase Authentication with Identity Platform.
* Cloud Firestore.
* Firebase Admin SDK.
* Firebase App Check integration points.
* Firebase Emulator Suite.
* Zod.
* React Hook Form.
* TanStack Table.
* Sonner.
* Vitest.
* Playwright.
* Firestore Rules Unit Testing.

Do not introduce another primary database.

Do not use Redux unless there is a strong architectural requirement.

---

# 3. Architecture requirements

Envault must use an **API-first, multi-client architecture**.

The initial web application uses Next.js, but the platform must not be designed as a web-only Firestore application.

Use Next.js Route Handlers as:

* A Backend for Frontend for the website.
* A versioned application API for future clients.
* An authorization boundary.
* A validation boundary.
* A stable interface over Firestore.

The website must not directly access Firestore for core domain operations.

Firestore access should occur through server-side repositories and application services.

The architecture should follow:

```text
Next.js Website
       │
       │ HTTPS / typed API client
       ▼
Next.js Route Handlers — /api/v1
       │
       ▼
Application Services
       │
       ▼
Domain Layer
       │
       ▼
Firestore Repositories
       │
       ▼
Cloud Firestore
```

Future clients should follow:

```text
VS Code Extension
       │
       │ HTTPS / typed API client
       ▼
Envault /api/v1
```

Do not place important business logic directly inside:

* React components.
* Route Handlers.
* Server Actions.
* Firestore repositories.

Route Handlers should handle only:

* Authentication.
* Authorization context.
* Request parsing.
* Input validation.
* Application-service invocation.
* Error-to-HTTP mapping.
* Typed responses.

---

# 4. Monorepo structure

Use a structure similar to:

```text
envault/

│   └── decisions/
│
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
├── turbo.json
└── package.json
```

The `apps/vscode-extension` application does not need to be fully implemented in the initial release, but the shared packages and APIs must make it possible to add later without redesigning the platform.

---

# 5. API design

Expose a versioned API under:

```text
/api/v1
```

Create endpoints similar to:

```text
/api/v1/auth/session
/api/v1/auth/reauthenticate

/api/v1/vault
/api/v1/vault/status
/api/v1/vault/settings

/api/v1/projects
/api/v1/projects/:projectId

/api/v1/projects/:projectId/environments
/api/v1/environments/:environmentId
/api/v1/environments/:environmentId/variables
/api/v1/environments/:environmentId/changes
/api/v1/environments/:environmentId/import
/api/v1/environments/:environmentId/export
/api/v1/environments/:environmentId/compare
/api/v1/environments/:environmentId/revisions

/api/v1/variables/:variableId
/api/v1/variables/:variableId/revisions
/api/v1/revisions/:revisionId/restore

/api/v1/activity

/api/v1/device-authorizations
/api/v1/device-authorizations/:authorizationId
/api/v1/device-sessions
/api/v1/device-sessions/:sessionId
/api/v1/device-sessions/:sessionId/revoke
```

Use consistent JSON response envelopes.

Example success response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "environment-id",
    "name": "Development"
  },
  "meta": {
    "requestId": "request-id"
  }
}
```

Example error response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ENVIRONMENT_VERSION_CONFLICT",
    "message": "The environment was modified by another client.",
    "details": {
      "expectedVersion": 17,
      "currentVersion": 19
    }
  },
  "meta": {
    "requestId": "request-id"
  }
}
```

Use stable machine-readable error codes.

---

# 6. Shared API contracts

All API inputs and outputs must use shared Zod schemas from:

```text
packages/api-contract
```

Example:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

export const variableDtoSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  vaultId: z.string(),
  projectId: z.string(),
  environmentId: z.string(),

  key: z.string(),
  encryptedValue: z.string(),
  encryptionIv: z.string(),
  encryptionVersion: z.number().int(),

  visibility: z.enum(["secret", "protected", "plain"]),
  tags: z.array(z.string()),
  description: z.string().nullable(),

  createdAt: z.string().datetime(),
  updatedAt: z.string().datetime(),
});

export type VariableDto = z.infer<typeof variableDtoSchema>;
```

The schemas must be consumed by:

* Route Handlers.
* The website.
* The typed API client.
* Future VS Code extension.
* Future CLI.
* Tests.

Do not manually duplicate request or response types.

---

# 7. Typed API client

Create a reusable client in:

```text
packages/api-client
```

Example usage:

```typescript
const client = new EnvaultClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL,
  getAccessToken: async () => tokenProvider.getAccessToken(),
});

const environment = await client.environments.get(environmentId);

await client.environments.applyChanges(environmentId, {
  expectedVersion: environment.version,
  changes: [
    {
      operation: "upsert",
      variable: encryptedVariable,
    },
  ],
});
```

The website should consume the same client intended for future VS Code and CLI clients.

Do not allow the web application to use undocumented private Firestore behavior that future clients cannot access.

---

# 8. Encryption architecture

Envault must use client-side encryption.

Plaintext environment-variable values must never be sent to Firestore or the Envault API.

The flow is:

```text
Plaintext entered in client
        │
        ▼
Encrypted locally
        │
        ▼
Ciphertext sent through /api/v1
        │
        ▼
Ciphertext stored in Firestore
```

For reads:

```text
Ciphertext retrieved through /api/v1
        │
        ▼
Ciphertext decrypted locally
        │
        ▼
Plaintext displayed temporarily
```

The server must not have the ability to decrypt user secrets.

---

# 9. Shared encryption protocol

Implement the encryption protocol in:

```text
packages/crypto
```

The encryption protocol must be runtime-independent.

Provide separate adapters for:

```text
Browser → Web Crypto API
Node.js / VS Code → Node Web Crypto API
```

Both adapters must produce compatible ciphertext.

Define versioned encrypted payloads.

Example:

```typescript
interface EncryptedPayloadV1 {
  version: 1;
  algorithm: "AES-GCM";
  ciphertext: string;
  iv: string;
  additionalDataVersion: 1;
}
```

Use:

* AES-256-GCM for payload encryption.
* A cryptographically secure random IV for every encryption operation.
* A separate random vault data-encryption key.
* PBKDF2-SHA-256 for initial passphrase-based key derivation.
* A unique random salt per user.
* A configurable and documented iteration count.
* Authenticated additional data.

Authenticated additional data should include stable identifiers:

```text
vaultId
projectId
environmentId
variableId
encryptionVersion
```

Never reuse an IV with the same encryption key.

Never create custom cryptographic primitives.

---

# 10. Vault passphrase

Firebase does not expose the user’s authentication password.

Therefore, users must create a separate vault passphrase.

During vault setup:

1. Generate a random vault encryption key.
2. Derive a key-encryption key from the vault passphrase.
3. Wrap the vault encryption key using AES-GCM.
4. Store only the wrapped vault key and derivation metadata.
5. Keep the unlocked vault key only in memory.
6. Clear it when:

   * The vault is manually locked.
   * The user signs out.
   * The auto-lock timer expires.
   * The page is closed where practical.
   * Authentication becomes invalid.

Never store the vault passphrase.

Never store an unwrapped vault key in:

* Firestore.
* Cookies.
* localStorage.
* sessionStorage.
* IndexedDB.
* Logs.
* Analytics.

---

# 11. Recovery key

During vault creation:

* Generate a high-entropy recovery key.
* Display it once.
* Require the user to confirm it has been saved.
* Use it to create a second wrapped copy of the vault key.
* Do not store the raw recovery key.

Clearly explain:

* Firebase password reset does not reset the vault passphrase.
* Loss of both the passphrase and recovery key means encrypted data cannot be recovered.
* Envault administrators cannot decrypt the vault.

Do not create an administrative decryption backdoor.

---

# 12. Authentication requirements

Use Firebase Authentication.

Implement:

* Email and password registration.
* Email verification.
* Login.
* Logout.
* Password reset.
* Authentication-state restoration.
* Session revocation behavior.
* Recent-login checks.
* Reauthentication for sensitive operations.
* TOTP MFA enrollment.
* TOTP MFA challenge.
* TOTP MFA removal.
* Clear error handling.

Users may register before verifying their email, but unverified users must not be able to:

* Create a vault.
* Read vault metadata.
* Read projects.
* Read environments.
* Read ciphertext.
* Create or update vault data.

Create a dedicated verification page with:

* Verification status.
* Resend verification email.
* Refresh verification state.
* Change account action.
* Logout action.

---

# 13. TOTP MFA

Use Firebase Authentication with Identity Platform.

Support authenticator applications including:

* Microsoft Authenticator.
* Google Authenticator.
* Authy.
* Compatible TOTP applications.

The enrollment flow should include:

1. Reauthentication.
2. TOTP secret generation.
3. QR code display.
4. Manual setup key.
5. Verification-code input.
6. Enrollment confirmation.
7. Security-status update.

During login:

1. Detect that MFA is required.
2. Preserve the Firebase multi-factor resolver.
3. Show an MFA challenge page.
4. Accept a TOTP code.
5. Resolve the sign-in.
6. Establish the application session.

Do not collect Firebase passwords inside future VS Code extension UI.

---

# 14. Web session architecture

Use secure server-side session handling appropriate for Next.js.

The web flow should be:

```text
Firebase client authentication
        │
        ▼
Firebase ID token
        │
        ▼
Secure session exchange endpoint
        │
        ▼
HTTP-only secure session cookie
        │
        ▼
Server-side verification using Firebase Admin SDK
```

Use:

* HTTP-only cookies.
* Secure cookies in production.
* SameSite settings.
* CSRF protection for state-changing browser requests.
* Session expiration.
* Session revocation checks where appropriate.

Do not rely only on client-side React authentication state.

---

# 15. Future VS Code extension authentication

Prepare the platform for browser-based device authorization.

The expected future flow is:

```text
1. User runs “Envault: Sign In” in VS Code.
2. Extension creates a device authorization.
3. Extension opens the system browser.
4. User signs in through the Envault website.
5. User completes Firebase MFA.
6. User approves the device.
7. Extension exchanges a short-lived authorization code.
8. Extension receives a revocable device session.
9. Extension stores credentials in VS Code SecretStorage.
```

The extension must never request or store:

* Firebase password.
* TOTP secret.
* Raw recovery key.
* Long-lived unprotected credentials.

Reserve and document the required API endpoints:

```text
POST /api/v1/device-authorizations
GET  /api/v1/device-authorizations/:id
POST /api/v1/device-authorizations/:id/approve
POST /api/v1/device-authorizations/:id/exchange

GET    /api/v1/device-sessions
DELETE /api/v1/device-sessions/:id
```

Device authorization codes must be:

* Short-lived.
* Single-use.
* Random.
* Hashed before persistence.
* Bound to the requesting client.
* Invalidated after exchange.

---

# 16. Device sessions

Design a device-session model.

Each device session should include:

```typescript
interface DeviceSession {
  id: string;
  ownerId: string;
  vaultId: string;

  name: string;
  clientType: "web" | "vscode" | "cli" | "desktop";
  clientVersion: string | null;
  platform: string | null;

  scopes: string[];

  createdAt: Timestamp;
  lastUsedAt: Timestamp;
  expiresAt: Timestamp;
  revokedAt: Timestamp | null;
}
```

Users must be able to review and revoke device sessions from the web application.

Support scopes such as:

```text
projects:read
environments:read
variables:read
variables:write
environments:export
environments:sync
```

Start with a simple scope model, but do not issue unrestricted permanent tokens.

---

# 17. Future VS Code vault unlocking

The VS Code extension must decrypt ciphertext locally.

The extension should use the shared `packages/crypto` protocol.

On first use, it may ask the user for:

* Their vault passphrase.
* Or their recovery key.

Optional future convenience:

* Create a device-specific wrapped vault key.
* Store only the device-wrapped material in VS Code SecretStorage.
* Allow the user to revoke the device from Envault.
* Invalidate the device-specific wrapping record when revoked.

Do not store an unwrapped vault key in the extension’s normal settings or workspace files.

---

# 18. Optimistic concurrency

The website, VS Code extension and future CLI may update the same environment.

Every environment must have:

```typescript
interface EnvironmentVersion {
  version: number;
  contentRevision: string;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

Every mutating request must include an expected version.

Example:

```json
{
  "expectedVersion": 17,
  "changes": [
    {
      "operation": "upsert",
      "variable": {
        "key": "API_URL",
        "encryptedValue": "ciphertext",
        "encryptionIv": "iv"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If the environment version has changed, return:

```http
409 Conflict
```

With:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ENVIRONMENT_VERSION_CONFLICT",
    "message": "The environment was changed by another client.",
    "details": {
      "expectedVersion": 17,
      "currentVersion": 19
    }
  }
}
```

Do not silently overwrite newer changes.

Use Firestore transactions for version checks and updates.

---

# 19. Idempotency

Support idempotency for important mutation requests, especially:

* Bulk updates.
* Imports.
* Synchronization.
* Device authorization exchange.
* Revision restore.

Allow clients to send:

```http
Idempotency-Key: unique-operation-id
```

Store a safe operation record so retries do not duplicate writes.

Do not store plaintext values in operation records.

---

# 20. Projects and environments

A project can contain multiple environments.

Example:

```text
Cosmos
├── Local
├── Development
├── Staging
└── Production
```

Project actions:

* Create.
* Update.
* Rename.
* Archive.
* Restore.
* Duplicate.
* Delete.

Environment actions:

* Create.
* Update.
* Rename.
* Duplicate.
* Archive.
* Restore.
* Delete.
* Import.
* Export.
* Compare.
* Synchronize.
* Copy selected variables.

Environment kinds:

```typescript
type EnvironmentKind =
  | "local"
  | "development"
  | "testing"
  | "staging"
  | "production"
  | "custom";
```

Production environments should have a clear warning treatment.

Sensitive production operations may require:

* Recent authentication.
* MFA.
* Confirmation using the environment name.

---

# 21. Variable model

Each variable should include:

```typescript
interface Variable {
  id: string;
  ownerId: string;
  vaultId: string;
  projectId: string;
  environmentId: string;

  key: string;
  normalizedKey: string;

  encryptedValue: string;
  encryptionIv: string;
  encryptionVersion: number;

  visibility: "secret" | "protected" | "plain";

  tags: string[];
  description: string | null;

  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

All values should be encrypted, including values classified as plain.

The visibility classification controls interface behavior, not storage encryption.

---

# 22. Variable editor

Build a high-quality environment editor using TanStack Table.

Columns:

* Selection.
* Key.
* Masked value.
* Visibility.
* Tags.
* Updated time.
* Actions.

Support:

* Inline editing.
* Keyboard navigation.
* Add-variable dialog.
* Search.
* Sorting.
* Filtering.
* Tag filtering.
* Visibility filtering.
* Pagination or virtualization.
* Optimistic UI.
* Safe rollback.
* Copy key.
* Copy value.
* Reveal temporarily.
* Rename.
* Duplicate.
* Copy to another environment.
* View revisions.
* Delete.

Secret values must be masked by default.

Do not place plaintext values in:

* HTML title attributes.
* URL query parameters.
* Analytics events.
* Error reports.
* Browser logs.

---

# 23. Bulk operations

Users must be able to select variables and:

* Delete them.
* Copy them.
* Move them.
* Add tags.
* Remove tags.
* Change visibility.
* Add a prefix.
* Remove a prefix.
* Convert keys to uppercase.
* Find and replace key text.
* Export selected variables.

Create a spreadsheet-style bulk editor.

The user should be able to paste:

```dotenv
API_URL=https://api.example.com
LOG_LEVEL=debug
FEATURE_NEW_HOME=true
```

Before committing, show:

```text
New variables: 12
Updated variables: 4
Unchanged variables: 8
Invalid variables: 2
Conflicts: 3
```

Conflict policies:

* Overwrite existing variables.
* Skip existing variables.
* Import only new variables.
* Review conflicts individually.

Chunk large operations safely.

Return progress information.

Use idempotency keys.

Use expected environment versions.

---

# 24. Import formats

Support:

* `.env`
* `.env.local`
* `.env.development`
* `.env.production`
* Pasted dotenv content.
* JSON objects.
* Shell-style `export KEY=value`.

Support:

* Empty values.
* Quoted values.
* Escaped characters.
* Comments.
* Duplicate-key detection.
* Variable-reference preservation.
* Safely parseable multiline values.

Do not execute:

* Shell commands.
* Command substitutions.
* JavaScript.
* Templates.
* Arbitrary expressions.

Treat suspicious content as literal text and show a warning.

---

# 25. Export formats

Support:

* `.env`
* JSON.
* Shell exports.
* Docker Compose environment snippet.
* Kubernetes Secret YAML.

Export must occur locally after decryption.

Do not send plaintext export content to the server.

Do not store generated exports in Firestore.

Clearly explain that Kubernetes base64 values are encoded, not encrypted.

---

# 26. Environment comparison

Allow users to compare any two environments.

Classify variables as:

* Identical.
* Different value.
* Missing from source.
* Missing from destination.
* Different visibility.
* Different tags or metadata.

Support:

* Copy source to destination.
* Copy destination to source.
* Synchronize selected.
* Ignore selected differences.
* Export a difference report.

Comparison should occur locally after decrypting ciphertext.

Do not persist plaintext comparison results.

---

# 27. Revision history

Create revisions for:

* Variable creation.
* Value update.
* Key rename.
* Visibility update.
* Metadata update.
* Deletion.
* Restoration.

Any revision snapshot containing a value must be encrypted.

Do not decrypt all revision values when loading the history list.

Decrypt only the selected revision.

Restoring a revision must create a new revision rather than rewriting history.

---

# 28. Firestore collections

Use a model similar to:

```text
users/{userId}

vaults/{vaultId}
vaults/{vaultId}/projects/{projectId}
vaults/{vaultId}/environments/{environmentId}
vaults/{vaultId}/variables/{variableId}
vaults/{vaultId}/revisions/{revisionId}
vaults/{vaultId}/activity/{activityId}
vaults/{vaultId}/operations/{operationId}
vaults/{vaultId}/deviceSessions/{deviceSessionId}
vaults/{vaultId}/deviceAuthorizations/{authorizationId}
```

All vault-owned documents must include:

```typescript
ownerId: string;
vaultId: string;
createdAt: Timestamp;
updatedAt: Timestamp;
```

Use server timestamps where appropriate.

Document all required Firestore indexes.

---

# 29. Firestore Security Rules

Create strict Firestore Security Rules even though core application access uses server-side repositories.

Rules must:

* Deny unauthenticated access.
* Deny access for unverified accounts.
* Enforce ownership.
* Prevent owner ID mutation.
* Prevent vault ID mutation.
* Validate document fields.
* Validate field types.
* Validate allowed enums.
* Limit arrays.
* Limit ciphertext sizes.
* Prevent cross-user access.
* Deny unknown document shapes where practical.

Use reusable rules functions.

Provide emulator tests for:

* Unauthenticated access.
* Unverified accounts.
* Owner access.
* Cross-user reads.
* Cross-user writes.
* Owner reassignment.
* Invalid fields.
* Invalid enums.
* Oversized ciphertext.
* Invalid batch writes.

Do not deploy permissive rules.

---

# 30. Activity logging

Record non-sensitive events:

* Login.
* Logout.
* MFA enrollment.
* MFA removal.
* Vault creation.
* Project creation.
* Environment creation.
* Variable creation.
* Variable update.
* Variable deletion.
* Import.
* Export request.
* Bulk update.
* Device authorization.
* Device session creation.
* Device session revocation.
* Revision restoration.

Never log:

* Plaintext variable values.
* Vault passphrases.
* Recovery keys.
* TOTP secrets.
* Encryption keys.
* Complete import content.
* Complete export content.
* Authentication tokens.

Use structured logging with request IDs.

---

# 31. Web application routes

Create routes similar to:

```text
/
├── login
├── register
├── verify-email
├── forgot-password
├── mfa-challenge
├── device
│   └── authorize
└── app

# Phase 11 — VS Code Extension Maturity

The extension today authenticates through browser-based device authorization and
can list projects and environments, but it never touches `@envault/crypto`. It
can read metadata only — it cannot decrypt or write a single variable value. This
phase turns it into a tool a developer actually installs: **pull an environment
into `.env`, edit safely, and push back — without plaintext ever leaving the
machine, and without clobbering another client's changes.**

All primitives already exist. `vault.get()` returns the wrapped vault-key
material and derivation metadata; `@envault/crypto` provides
`unlockVaultWithPassphrase`, `unlockVaultWithRecoveryKey`,
`encryptVariableValue` and `decryptVariableValue`; `@envault/dotenv` provides the
shared parser and serializer; and Node's global `crypto.subtle` lets the existing
browser provider run unchanged in the extension host. This phase is wiring and
UX, not new cryptography.

## Design decisions

* **Unlock once per device.** The user is not asked for their passphrase on every
  session. On first unlock (passphrase or recovery key) the extension creates a
  **device-wrapped copy** of the vault key. The random device secret is kept in
  VS Code `SecretStorage`; the device-wrapped key material is stored **server-side,
  bound to the current device session**, so revoking the device from the web
  invalidates the wrapping record and disables silent unlock. Neither the
  passphrase, the recovery key, nor the unwrapped vault key is ever persisted.
* **Unwrapped vault key lives in memory only** and is cleared on lock, sign-out,
  auto-lock expiry and window close — matching Plan §17.
* **Reuse shared packages.** `@envault/crypto` and `@envault/dotenv` only; the
  extension continues to use `/api/v1` through `@envault/api-client` and never
  connects directly to Redis or Firebase.

### Stage A — Local decryption foundation

- [x] Add `@envault/crypto` and `@envault/dotenv` as extension dependencies.
- [x] Expose a `getNodeCryptoProvider()` in `packages/crypto` (thin alias over the
      existing provider using the Node global `crypto`); assert `subtle` is present.
- [x] Add an in-memory vault-key holder with an auto-lock timer sourced from vault
      settings; clear it on lock, sign-out, expiry and `deactivate`.
- [x] `Envault: Unlock vault` — prompt for passphrase or recovery key via a masked
      input, fetch `vault.get()`, derive and unwrap the key, hold it in memory.
- [x] `Envault: Lock vault`.

### Stage B — Device-wrapped key (no repeated passphrase)

- [x] Add a `"device"` purpose to the key-wrapping additional-data union in
      `packages/crypto`.
- [x] On first successful unlock, generate a random 32-byte device secret, wrap the
      vault key with it, and store the secret in `SecretStorage`.
- [x] Add endpoints to store and fetch the device-wrapped key material bound to the
      current device session (`PUT`/`GET`/`DELETE /api/v1/device/vault-key`); persist
      only ciphertext and IV — never the device secret or any plaintext.
- [x] On later sessions, fetch the wrapped material and combine it with the local
      device secret to unwrap silently — no passphrase prompt.
- [x] Revoking the device session from the web invalidates the wrapping record; the
      extension falls back to passphrase unlock.

### Stage C — Pull

- [x] `Envault: Pull environment` — decrypt every variable locally and serialize with
      `@envault/dotenv` into a workspace `.env` file.
- [x] Warn and show a diff before overwriting an existing `.env`.
- [x] Remember the target file per environment.

### Stage D — Push with concurrency safety

- [x] `Envault: Push environment` — parse the local `.env` with `@envault/dotenv` and
      show a preview classifying variables as new, updated, unchanged or invalid.
- [x] Encrypt values locally, then commit via the import endpoint with an expected
      environment version and a per-chunk idempotency key.
- [x] On HTTP 409, present Overwrite / Compare-&-merge choices; re-plan against the
      latest version so retries never push stale data.

### Stage E — Native UX

- [x] Status-bar item showing lock state and the selected `project / environment`,
      clickable to open Envault quick actions.
- [x] Activity Bar tree view: projects → environments → variables (masked keys), with
      pull and push from context menus. *(In-tree temporary reveal deferred — reveal
      is available by pulling into `.env`.)*
- [x] `.env` compare against remote (on-demand diff during pull and push conflicts).
      *(A standing CodeLens drift indicator is deferred.)*
- [x] Per-workspace-folder environment binding for multi-root workspaces.

### Stage F — Hardening and Marketplace

- [x] Unit tests for push preview/conflict classification and device-key wrapping.
- [ ] Integration test driving pull/push against a mock `EnvaultClient`. *(Deferred —
      requires a VS Code test host harness.)*
- [x] Secret-leak review: no plaintext values, passphrases, recovery keys, device
      secrets or vault keys in logs, notifications, telemetry or workspace state.
- [x] First-run `walkthrough` contribution and updated `README`/`CHANGELOG`.
- [x] Scope `activationEvents` (`onView:envault.explorer`); handle expired and revoked
      sessions gracefully.

### Acceptance criteria

- [x] The unwrapped vault key exists only in memory; nothing persistent holds the
      passphrase, recovery key or unwrapped key.
- [x] The passphrase is entered at most once per device until the device is revoked.
- [x] Pull writes a correct decrypted `.env`; push round-trips without any plaintext
      leaving the machine.
- [x] Stale pushes return HTTP 409 and surface Overwrite / Compare-&-merge.
- [x] Revoking the device from the web disables silent unlock.
- [x] Lint, typecheck, unit tests and the extension build pass.
